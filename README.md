# Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

Author: Mithlesh Upadhyay

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a hybrid model for stock price or performance prediction. It combines numerical analysis of historical stock prices with sentimental analysis of news headlines to make predictions. The specific stock we are analyzing and predicting is SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX).

## Project Description
In this project, we have utilized a combination of numerical and textual data analysis techniques to predict stock market trends. Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Numerical Analysis**: We have performed historical stock price analysis to extract relevant numerical features. This includes factors such as open, close, high, low prices, trading volume, and more.

2. **Textual Analysis**: We have collected news headlines related to the SENSEX stock from various sources. Sentiment analysis techniques are applied to this textual data to gauge market sentiment and extract valuable insights.

3. **Hybrid Model**: To make predictions, we have developed a hybrid model that incorporates both the numerical features from historical stock prices and the sentiment analysis results from news headlines.

## Stock to Analyze
The stock that we are focusing on for this project is SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX). SENSEX is one of the most widely tracked equity indices in India and is a key indicator of the Indian stock market's overall performance.

## Key Features
- Numerical analysis of historical stock prices.
- Sentiment analysis of news headlines.
- Development of a hybrid model for stock market prediction.

## Usage
This project can be used as a foundation for stock market prediction using both numerical and textual data. You can further customize and extend the model for other stocks and financial markets.
